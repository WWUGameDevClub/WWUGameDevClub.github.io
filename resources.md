### Free Tools

Here you’ll find tools that are free for anyone to use, regardless of
who you are. Each section contains a brief description of the tool, as
well as including a download or setup link.

#### Git

Git is one of the most common version control systems out there. It’s
powerful and fairly easy to use. The exact method of installation
depends on which OS you happen to be running, and exactly how familiar
you are with the command line. [This GitHub
page](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/) walks you through a couple
of steps for getting Git set up; for more information beyond that head over to
the [Git tutorials](##tutorials-git). Using version control is highly
recommended for anyone that codes; even non-coders can find it useful to keep
every version of their files backed up.

#### Blender

Blender is a powerful, open-source 3D modeling tool. It’s got a fairly
steep learning curve, but includes a fairly robust game engine and makes
heavy use of Python. You can find more information on [Blender’s
website](http://www.blender.org), or jump straight to the (download
page)\[http://www.blender.org/download/\]. Tutorials can be a bit tricky to
come across, although it has gotten better in recent years; we’ve cataloged
a few of the better ones in our [Blender tutorial](#tutorials-blender)
section.

#### sfxr

sfxr is a tool created by Tomas Pettersson, handle DrPetter, for the
10th Ludum Dare. It’s a very powerful sound effect generator; although
most of its sounds are more appropriate for pixel-art style games, with
a little tinkering you can generate incredibly varied sounds. You can
find more information and a download link for Windows and OS X on [his
website](http://www.drpetter.se/project_sfxr.html).

#### cgMusic

cgMusic is a program that generates music. More accurately, it composes
MIDI files; although these files on their own probably won’t sound
stellar, most music editing programs will be able to load the file and
export it with different instruments, or modify it and then export it.
The program is a stellar piece of work; you can find it
[here](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax#list).

#### Audacity

[Audacity](http://audacity.sourceforge.net/) is arguably the best free audio
editor out there, outclassing even some paid software. A must have for anyone
working with audio.

#### FireAlpaca

FireAlpaca is basically a free Photoshop substitute for Windows and OS
X. My roommate uses it and he seems mostly happy with it; at the very
least it’s better than GIMP. You can download it from the [FireAlpaca
website](http://firealpaca.com/en).

#### Inkscape

Inkscape is a vector art tool, much like Adobe Illustrator. If you
aren’t familiar with vector graphics, they’re a type of graphic (usually
stored as .svg files) that scale perfectly. They do this by storing data
about how lines are formed, rather than the actual pixel values
themselves. I’m not really sure how relevant this is to game design, but
some of the artists might appreciate it. You can get it [from their
site](http://inkscape.org/en/).

#### Unity

Unity3D (usually referred to just as Unity) is an incredibly powerful
game making utility that includes both web and desktop publishing for
free, and can publish to almost any platform out there provided you have
enough money. It’s a great way to get into making games if you don’t
like mucking about in code too much (chances are you will still have to
write *some* code in either JavaScript or C\#). It can also do 2D,
although from what I hear it’s still a bit on the buggy side. You can download
Unity [here](http://unity3d.com/unity/download), and a comparison of the
feature list between the free and Pro versions can be found
[here](http://unity3d.com/unity/licenses). We also have a number of [Unity
tutorials](##tutorials-unity).

#### XNA

The XNA Framework (which stands for “XNA’s Not Acronymed”) was
originally developed by Microsoft as a framework people could use to
develop indie games for the Xbox 360. It also works quite well for
Windows deployment. XNA is basically a wrapper around DirectX with a
number of built-in classes you would end up writing anyway if you were
using raw DirectX, but it ends up being easier to use than raw DirectX.
Unfortunately, the framework was deprecated a few years ago.
[MonoGame](http://www.monogame.net/) is supposed to be a drop-in
(cross-platform!) replacement for XNA using the [Mono
Project](http://www.mono-project.com/), a cross-platform implementation of the
CLR (Common Language Runtime) that C\# runs on. If you want to download XNA
instead of MonoGame, you can find Game Studio 4.0 Refresh on [Microsoft’s
website](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=27599). Be
warned, however: you will need either Visual Studio C\# 2010 Express or Visual
Studio Professional 2010 to install it (and additionally, installing on Windows
8 is another hassle). Once XNA is installed, you can upgrade to Visual Studio
2012 and perform a couple tricks to get it working; for more information on
this (or on getting MonoGame set up) see the section on [XNA
tutorials](#tutorials-xna).

### Student Tools

### Tutorials

Ever wanted to learn how to use a particular tool? Here’s your chance!
Most of the entries in this section are just lists of links to places
with a short description about what you should expect to find on the
other end.

#### Using Git

-   [Git SCM](http://www.git-scm.com/book/en/Getting-Started): The
    de-facto book on Git. Perhaps a little wordy, but great
    for learning.
-   [Git By Example](http://gitbyexample.org/): Step by step tutorial
    that includes getting Git set up.

#### Blender

-   [BlenderArtists forum](http://blenderartists.org/forum/): There are
    pleny of things here for new users, but if you try to start an
    MMORPG thread, they will kill you.
-   [Blender Cookie](http://cgcookie.com/blender): Run by the same guys
    as BlenderArtists; more on the modeling/rendering side than game dev
-   [Blender Guru](http://www.blenderguru.com/): A little easier to
    understand for the novice, but has some helpful tips; more on the
    modeling/rendering side than game dev
-   [blendENZO](http://blendenzo.com/): Great resources if you know
    enough about Blender to “translate” the concepts from older versions
    of Blender to newer ones. Hasn’t been updated for a while.
-   [Burster](http://geta3d.com/): Web Plugin to put your Blender games
    online
-   [Other Blender Tutorials](http://tutorialsforblender3d.com/): Great

    good resource on Unity.

#### Python

-   [CodeAcademy](http://www.codecademy.com/): Online tutorials with
    interpreters to help you learn Python.
-   [Python Docs](https://docs.python.org/2.7/tutorial/index.html):
    Python has a tutorial to help you learn the language, although it
    may assume some prior programming experience.

Nothing here yet.

#### XNA

-   [How to get XNA working with
    VS2012+](http://stackoverflow.com/a/10881007/1477697): This

    versions of Visual Studio.
-   [Riemer’s XNA Tutorials](http://www.riemers.net/eng/tutorials.php):
    One of the greatest sources of XNA tutorials I know. The website’s
    navigation is a bit unclear; you’ll want to go through the Tutorials
    section on the sidebar.
