### <a name="free-tools">Free Tools</a>

Here you'll find tools that are free for anyone to use, regardless of who you are. Each section contains a brief description of the tool, as well as including a download or setup link.

#### <a name="free-tools-git">Git</a>

Git is one of the most common version control systems out there. It's powerful and fairly easy to use. The exact method of installation depends on which OS you happen to be running, and exactly how familiar you are with the command line. [This GitHub page](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/) walks you through a couple of steps for getting Git set up; for more information beyond that head over to the [Git tutorials](#tutorials-git). Using version control is highly recommended for anyone that codes; even non-coders can find it useful to keep every version of their files backed up.

#### <a name="free-tools-blender">Blender</a>

Blender is a powerful, open-source 3D modeling tool. It's got a fairly steep learning curve, but includes a fairly robust game engine and makes heavy use of Python. You can find more information on [Blender's website](http://www.blender.org), or jump straight to the (download page)[http://www.blender.org/download/]. Tutorials can be a bit tricky to come across, although it has gotten better in recent years; we've cataloged a few of the better ones in our [Blender tutorial](#tutorials-blender) section.

#### <a name="free-tools-sfxr">sfxr</a>

sfxr is a tool created by Tomas Pettersson, handle DrPetter, for the 10th Ludum Dare. It's a very powerful sound effect generator; although most of its sounds are more appropriate for pixel-art style games, with a little tinkering you can generate incredibly varied sounds. You can find more information and a download link for Windows and OS X on [his website](http://www.drpetter.se/project_sfxr.html). 

#### <a name="free-tools-audacity">Audacity</a>

[Audacity](http://audacity.sourceforge.net/) is arguably the best free audio editor out there, outclassing even some paid software. A must have for anyone working with audio.

#### <a name="free-tools-firealpaca">FireAlpaca</a>

FireAlpaca is basically a free Photoshop substitute for Windows and OS X. My roommate uses it and he seems mostly happy with it; at the very least it's better than GIMP. You can download it from the [FireAlpaca website](http://firealpaca.com/en).

#### <a name="free-tools-inkscape">Inkscape</a>

Inkscape is a vector art tool, much like Adobe Illustrator. If you aren't familiar with vector graphics, they're a type of graphic (usually stored as .svg files) that scale perfectly. They do this by storing data about how lines are formed, rather than the actual pixel values themselves. I'm not really sure how relevant this is to game design, but some of the artists might appreciate it. You can get it [from their site](http://inkscape.org/en/).

#### <a name="free-tools-unity">Unity</a>

Unity3D (usually referred to just as Unity) is an incredibly powerful game making utility that includes both web and desktop publishing for free, and can publish to almost any platform out there provided you have enough money. It's a great way to get into making games if you don't like mucking about in code too much (chances are you will still have to write *some* code in either JavaScript or C#). It can also do 2D, although from what I hear it's still a bit on the buggy side. You can download Unity [here](http://unity3d.com/unity/download), and a comparison of the feature list between the free and Pro versions can be found [here](http://unity3d.com/unity/licenses). We also have a number of [Unity tutorials](#tutorials-unity).

#### <a name="free-tools-xna">XNA</a>

The XNA Framework (which stands for "XNA's Not Acronymed") was originally developed by Microsoft as a framework people could use to develop indie games for the Xbox 360. It also works quite well for Windows deployment. XNA is basically a wrapper around DirectX with a number of built-in classes you would end up writing anyway if you were using raw DirectX, but it ends up being easier to use than raw DirectX. Unfortunately, the framework was deprecated a few years ago. [MonoGame](http://www.monogame.net/) is supposed to be a drop-in (cross-platform!) replacement for XNA using the [Mono Project](http://www.mono-project.com/), a cross-platform implementation of the CLR (Common Language Runtime) that C# runs on. If you want to download XNA instead of MonoGame, you can find Game Studio 4.0 Refresh on [Microsoft's website](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=27599). Be warned, however: you will need either Visual Studio C# 2010 Express or Visual Studio Professional 2010 to install it (and additionally, installing on Windows 8 is another hassle). Once XNA is installed, you can upgrade to Visual Studio 2012 and perform a couple tricks to get it working; for more information on this (or on getting MonoGame set up) see the section on [XNA tutorials](#tutorials-xna).

### <a name="student-tools">Student Tools</a>

This section lists tools that can be acquired for free if you're a student. You'll want to check the licenses carefully before downloading them to see what you can and can't do with them, as well as to find out if you'll have to start paying for them after you graduate.

#### <a name="student-tools-github">GitHub's Student Developer Pack</a>

GitHub offers a number of free services and tools to students on the [GitHub Education](https://education.github.com/pack/) website. There's 14 different things offered, but probably the most interesting is Unreal Engine 4. All you have to do to get it is link your student email to your GitHub account and fill out a short form that includes the question "How will you use GitHub?". The application says it will be reviewed and they'll get back to you in a week, but mine was immediately accepted; it might partially be dependent on how often you use GitHub.

#### <a name="student-tools-dreamspark">DreamSpark</a>

Microsoft offers a lot (a *lot*) of free software to students through their DreamSpark program. I know for sure you can get Office, Visual Studio, and various versions of Windows; there's also a lot of other stuff they offer. You can learn more about it and sign up [here](https://www.dreamspark.com/Student/Default.aspx).
