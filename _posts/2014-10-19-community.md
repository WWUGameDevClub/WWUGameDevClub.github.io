If you're interested in the indie community as a whole, or interested in going on to make indie games, you'll want to get involved with these places. Firstly: Indie developers live on Twitter. I don't know why, but they do. Tweeting with #gamedev or #indiedev will get you into the community fast, as well as following and interacting with other people using those hashtags. There's a number of bots dedicated to religiously retweeting those hashtags as well. Feel free to follow club leader Alex [on Twitter](http://twitter.com/_snoozbuster). 

Reddit is a terrible place, but [/r/gamedev](http://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/) is slightly less of a terrible place. There's always dedicated threads to Screenshot Saturdays, and you can get feedback from other indies on your projects. You might be able to recruit people there or ask for help as well; I'm not very familiar with the subreddit myself.

Getting into game jams is another great way to get into the community. The biggest is [Ludum Dare](http://ludumdare.com/compo/); they also have an IRC channel on AfterNET#ludumdare. [One Game a Month (1GAM)](http://www.onegameamonth.com/) is another great place to get into indie games. Additionally, [itch.io](http://itch.io/) provides free hosting for indie games; no matter what you make I recommend putting it up here to get indie/Twitter cred.
