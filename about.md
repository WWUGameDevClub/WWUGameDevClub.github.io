Who Are we?
-----------

We are the WWU Game Design Club and we pride ourselves with learning the in and outs of all types of games. We have our biggest event, The Game Jam, where it happens quarterly in Western Washington University.

What is our goal?
-----------------

We aim to educate, inform, and entertain our members with lectures from community game designers, artists, and programmers.
